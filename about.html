                <h2>About Almighty Worship Band</h2>

                <p>AWB is a team of singers and musicians from Ahmedabad city, Gujarat India who are desperately spreading
                    the gospel of Jesus through their songs like, “Muskura”, “Yeshu Raja”, “Teri Aur”, “Jitna Khush”, in
                    India and the world over</p>
                <p>We travel to different areas of the country (especially in Gujarat) to do Worship Events/Concerts. Through
                    worship we encourage all the generations to spread the Gospel of Jesus <b><u>“JESUS IS COMING SOON”.</b></u></p>

                <p>Jesus. Yes, Bible Says <u><b>(Acts 16:31):</u></b> If you believe that Jesus is the Lord then you and
                    your household will be saved and will get eternal life with him in heaven.</p>
                <br>
                <h3><u>Inspirational Bible Story for Worshipers: Acts 16:25-40</u></h3>

                <p>In the mid-night Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and other prisoners were listening
                    to them. Suddenly there was a violent earthquake and everyone’s chains came loose.</p>

                <p>Yes, what we really believe is that we have the power of worship. When we worship in the name of our Lord
                    Jesus our chains of sorrow, pain, grief, loneliness, will be loosed and not only ours but the chains
                    of those who are listening to our worship/singing. We have the power and authority to break the chains
                    of our life through worship in the name of our Lord Jesus <u><b>“If we believe”.</u></b></p>
                <br>
                <h3><u>Live Testimony:</u></h3>
                <p>In the year 2001 in India, a young boy was crying and praying in his room, while he was praying to the
                    Lord Jesus for others who are in pain, suddenly he saw a light in his room and the room was filled with
                    brightness. He opened his eyes to see what is happening and he saw someone was standing in that brightness,
                    and then he heard a voice that <u><b>“I am coming soon, share this message/testimony to as many people
                            as you can because the time is near”.</u></b> From that day, the boy was spreading the gospel
                    to people as Jesus said to him to do.</p>
                Yes, Jesus is coming soon to bring his believers to heaven, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye <u><b>(1
                        Corinthians 15:52).</u></b>
